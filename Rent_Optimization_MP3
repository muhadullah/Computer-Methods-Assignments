    Say a real estate office handles 50 apartment units.
    When the rent is $600 per month, all the units are occupied.
    However, for each $40 increase in rent, one unit becomes vacant.
    Moreover, each occupied unit requires an average of $27 per month for maintenance.
   
    How many units should be rented to maximize the profit?
 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter:
1.The total number of units..
2.The rent to occupy all the units..
3.The increase in rent that results in a vacant unit..
4.Amount to maintain a rented unit.. */
